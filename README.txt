Explanation of Directories:

    /cmd
        This directory is typically used for the main applications of your project. Each application has its own subdirectory (example in this case), which contains a main.go file. This structure is helpful when your project needs to generate multiple executables.

    /internal
        The internal folder is used to hold private application and library code. This code is not intended to be imported by other applications. It's a good place to keep the code that your executables need but should be hidden from other packages.

    /pkg
        The pkg directory is intended to hold library code that's okay to use by external applications. This is where you would put the publicly accessible parts of your application (e.g., packages that can be imported by other projects).

    /bin
        This directory is often used to store the compiled executables and is usually added to .gitignore in version control. It's more of a convenience directory; you don't have to version control the binaries.

    /logs
        It's uncommon to include a logs directory in the project structure; usually, logs are written to a system log directory or a directory outside the project. However, if you include it for development purposes, ensure itâ€™s also in .gitignore.

    go.mod
        The go.mod file at the root of your project directory declares the module's path, which serves as the dependency root. This file also manages dependencies in a way that ensures version consistency across all packages and modules.

Considerations:

    Naming and Usage: Ensure that the use of internal and pkg is justified. internal is great for when you have code that shouldn't be exposed outside the project, while pkg is for code that you intend to be importable by other projects.
    Version Control: Remember to use a .gitignore file to exclude files and directories that should not be tracked with version control, such as bin/ and logs/.
